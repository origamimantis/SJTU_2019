ros kinetic on ubuntu 16.04

ardrone_autonomy


files in opencvtest should run fine, I'm pretty sure opencv is installed by default. Else, install opencv 2


files in drone_ws require installation of ros kinetic on ubuntu 16.04 (use virtual machine)
in addition to ardrone_autonomy (find by google search)
